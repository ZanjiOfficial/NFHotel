# 🏨 NF Hotel

NF Hotel is a web-based hotel management system developed as part of a software development project. The system is designed to improve the management of hotel bookings, guests, rooms, pricing, and check-in workflows.

The project is based on the requirements gathered during the **NF Hotel 1.0 process** and focuses on creating a more efficient and user-friendly solution for hotel staff.

The system is being developed with **Blazor**, **PostgreSQL**, and a web API architecture, with the goal of supporting both internal hotel management and future integrations with external booking platforms.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of NF Hotel is to develop a modern hotel management solution that makes everyday hotel operations easier and more efficient.

The system focuses on:

* Managing hotel bookings
* Managing guest information
* Connecting guests with their assigned rooms
* Supporting walk-in guests
* Managing passport information for check-in
* Managing room prices and discounts
* Providing a clear and usable booking calendar
* Providing sales and pricing overviews
* Providing an API for future integrations
* Creating a foundation for integration with external booking platforms

---

## ✨ Customer Requirements

The following requirements are based on the customer's wishes from the **NF Hotel 1.0 process**.

### 🛂 Passport Details

The system should support passport information as part of the guest and booking workflow.

Requirements:

* Add a **Passport ID** field to guest information.
* Allow hotel staff to upload an image of the guest's passport.
* Keep the following information together:

  * Booking
  * Guest
  * Passport ID
  * Passport image
* Make passport information easily accessible during check-in.

This is intended to make the check-in process faster and reduce the need to search for information across multiple systems.

---

### 🚶 Walk-in Guests

Hotel guests who arrive without a prior booking or without an email address should still be able to be registered.

Requirements:

* Remove the mandatory email requirement from **New Booking**.
* Allow bookings to be created without an email address.
* Support hotel staff entering guest information manually.

This is particularly important for walk-in guests who may not have an email address available.

---

### 📅 Calendar Improvements

The booking calendar should provide a clearer overview of hotel occupancy and booking status.

Requirements:

* Highlight the booking that has been clicked or selected.
* Provide a clear visual indication of the selected booking.
* Add a **color legend** explaining the different booking statuses.
* Make it easier for hotel staff to understand the current booking situation.

The goal is to make the calendar easier and faster to use during everyday hotel operations.

---

### 👤 Guest Overview

The guest overview should make it easy to identify where a guest is staying.

Requirements:

* Display the guest's assigned room number.
* Provide clear **guest ↔ room traceability**.
* Make the assigned room visible from the relevant guest information.

This allows hotel staff to quickly determine which room belongs to a specific guest.

---

### 💰 Special Pricing & Discounts

The system should support special pricing for selected hotel rooms.

Requirements:

* Add discount pricing for ect **rooms 8, 9, and 10**.
* Make the discounted prices available when editing room prices.
* Reflect pricing changes in the **Sales Overview**.
* Ensure that the displayed prices are consistent throughout the system.

---

### 🌐 Web-based Solution

NF Hotel is being developed as a web-based solution rather than a traditional desktop-only application.

The system should provide:

* A web-based user interface.
* A backend API.
* Database integration.
* Support for website bookings.
* A foundation for integration with external booking platforms.
* A scalable architecture that can be extended in the future.

The API architecture is intended to make it possible for external systems to communicate with NF Hotel.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running NF Hotel locally, make sure you have the following installed.

### 💻 Development Environment

* **Visual Studio 2022** or newer
* **.NET SDK** compatible with the project's target framework
* **PostgreSQL**
* **Git**

Visual Studio should have the appropriate **ASP.NET and web development** workload installed.

### 🔧 Recommended

For development, it is also recommended to have:

* PostgreSQL administration tool such as pgAdmin
* GitHub account
* A database management tool
* Access to the required project configuration and environment variables

---

## 🚀 How To Get Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZanjiOfficial/NFHotel.git
```

Navigate into the project:

```bash
cd NFHotel
```

---

### 2️⃣ Open the Project

Open the solution in **Visual Studio**.

Locate the `.sln` file and open it.

Alternatively, the project can be opened directly through Visual Studio using:

```text
File → Open → Project/Solution
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure PostgreSQL

Create a PostgreSQL database for NF Hotel.

For example:

```text
Database: nfhotel
```

The exact database name and connection settings should match the project's configuration.

Configure the database connection using the appropriate application configuration, such as:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=nfhotel;Username=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```

**Do not commit real passwords, API keys, or other secrets to GitHub.**

---

### 4️⃣ Restore Dependencies

From the project directory:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Build the project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

---

### 5️⃣ Set Up the Database

If the project uses Entity Framework Core migrations, apply the migrations using:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

If Entity Framework CLI is not installed:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Then run:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

> The exact database setup may depend on the current implementation of the project.

---

### 6️⃣ Run the Application

The application can be started from Visual Studio using:

```text
F5
```

or:

```text
Ctrl + F5
```

It can also be started from the terminal with:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Visual Studio will provide the local URL where the application is running.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration should be kept outside the source code whenever possible.

Typical configuration includes:

* PostgreSQL connection string
* API configuration
* Authentication settings
* External service credentials
* File/image storage configuration
* Environment-specific settings

### 🔐 Environment Variables

Sensitive values should preferably be supplied through environment variables or local development configuration.

For example:

```text
DATABASE_HOST
DATABASE_PORT
DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_USER
DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

Never commit production credentials or sensitive customer data to the repository.

---

## 🗄️ Database

NF Hotel uses **PostgreSQL** as its relational database.

The database is responsible for storing information such as:

* Guests
* Bookings
* Rooms
* Room prices
* Discounts
* Passport IDs
* Passport image references
* Booking status
* Sales information

The database structure should maintain clear relationships between guests, bookings, and rooms.

A simplified relationship can be represented as:

```text
Guest
  │
  ├── Passport ID
  ├── Passport Image
  │
  └── Booking
        │
        ├── Check-in
        ├── Check-out
        ├── Status
        └── Room
              │
              ├── Room Number
              └── Price
```

---

## 🔌 API

NF Hotel includes a web API architecture intended to support communication between the hotel system and external applications.

Potential integrations include:

* Hotel website
* Online booking systems
* External booking platforms
* Third-party services
* Future mobile applications

The API provides a foundation for extending NF Hotel without requiring external applications to access the PostgreSQL database directly.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

NF Hotel handles potentially sensitive hotel and guest information.

Examples include:

* Guest information
* Passport IDs
* Passport images
* Booking information
* Hotel rates
* Sales information
* API data

Security and privacy are therefore important considerations throughout the development process.

Particular attention should be given to:

* Authentication and authorization
* Secure API endpoints
